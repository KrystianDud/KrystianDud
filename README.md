# Hi, I'm Krystian

## Featured Projects

### [ONTOUR](https://ontour.app) — Creating Football's Greatest Moments, Together
**Stack:** React Native, Expo, Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, AWS, CDN

---

### [ShieldTS](https://npmjs.com/package/shieldts) — Build-Time Security Scanner for TypeScript
Open-source NPM package that prevents production builds containing exposed secrets. Engineered multi-layered detection combining pattern matching, Shannon entropy analysis, and TypeScript AST parsing. Context-aware filtering eliminates false positives while catching real vulnerabilities.

The irony: GitHub's push protection initially blocked deployment due to test data containing fake API keys — the exact problem ShieldTS solves. (Worry not I think there is more ways to use this especially around less experience coders with educational module)

**Stack:** TypeScript, Node.js, TypeScript Compiler API, fast-glob, Commander.js

```bash
npm install -g shieldts
npx shieldts init
```
